Please fix the following:

1) Put all the files in a subdirectory "search-bar" of duckuments. Otherwise, it's a mess.
    Also, put intermediate files in search-bar/out/ and add .gitignore patterns.

2) Where is the documentation about this product?

3) Installation.

I had to do:

```
pip install --user regex
```

Also I had to do `npm install lunr` (without the `-g`) but I am not sure if it is my problem.


4) Not all required files are copied to the output directory (e.g. json files)

5) It does not work when used locally (it tries to open `/secids.json` rather than `secids.json`)
