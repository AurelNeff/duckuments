# Special paragraphs and environments {#markduck-special-pars status=ready  label-name="Special paragraphs"}

## Special paragraphs tags {#special-paragraphs}

The system supports parsing of some special paragraphs.

Note: some of these might be redundant and will be eliminated. For now,
I am documenting what is implemented.


### Special paragraphs must be separated by a line {#empty-line-before-special}

A special paragraph is marked by a special prefix.
The list of special prefixes is given in the next section.

There must be an empty line before a special paragraph;
this is because in Markdown a paragraph starts only after an empty line.

This is checked automatically, and the compilation will abort if the mistake is found.

For example, this is invalid:

    See: this book
    See: this other book

This is correct:

    See: this book

    See: this other book

Similarly, this is invalid:

    Author: author
    Maintainer: maintainer

and this is correct:

    Author: author

    Maintainer: maintainer

## Other `div` environments {#div-environments}

For these, note the rules:

- You must include `markdown="1"`.
- There must be an empty line after the first `div` and before the closing `/div`.

### Example usage

    <div class='example-usage' markdown="1">

    This is how you can use `rosbag`:

        $ rosbag play log.bag

    </div>

<div class='example-usage' markdown="1">

This is how you can use `rosbag`:


    $ rosbag play log.bag

</div>

    <div class='check' markdown="1">

    Check that you didn't forget anything.

    </div>

## Notes and questions {#notes-and-questions}

There are three environments: "comment", "question", "doubt",
that result in boxes that can be expanded by the user.

These are the one-paragraph forms:

    Comment: this is a comment on one paragraph.

Comment: this is a comment on one paragraph.

    Question: this is a question on one paragraph.

Question: this is a question on one paragraph.

    Doubt: I have my doubts on one paragraph.

Doubt: I have my doubts  on one paragraph.

These are the multiple-paragraphs forms:


    <div class='comment' markdown='1'>
    A comment...

    A second paragraph...
    </div>

<div class='comment' markdown='1'>
A comment...

A second paragraph...
</div>


    <div class='question' markdown='1'>
    A question...

    A second paragraph...
    </div>

<div class='question' markdown='1'>
A question...

A second paragraph...
</div>


    <div class='doubt' markdown='1'>
    A question...

    Should it not be:

        $ alternative command

    A second paragraph...
    </div>


<div class='doubt' markdown='1'>
A question...

Should it not be:

    $ alternative command

A second paragraph...
</div>
